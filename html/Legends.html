				<div class="tony-hawk-desc">Tony Hawk:</div>
				<p>Tony Hawk was 9 years old when his older brother gave him a blue fiberglass skateboard, scuffed and scratched from years of riding. When Tony stepped on him for the first time and rolled down the alley behind his San Diego home, he was not unique by any sign from above. He reached the end of the road, looked back at his brother and shouted: "How to turn?"
					Of course, over time, Tony mastered something more complicated than turns. While working out at the now defunct Oasis Skatepark, the short talented guy quickly began to attract attention. The tricks that he performed were often beyond the power of adults. At the age of 12 he won amateur competitions in California, at 14 he turned pro, and at 16 he became widely known as one of the best skateboarders in the world. By the age of 25, he took part in 103 competitions, winning 73 of them. This record has not been broken by any of the skateboarders so far. In addition, Tony Hawk became the world champion in vert skateboarding for 12 years in a row, which also pulls on a record.

				<p>At seventeen, Tony, a high school student, was earning more than his high school teachers. It was mostly royalties from his main sponsor, Powell Peralta, and before graduation he was able to buy his first house. Until the late 80s, Tony traveled a lot around the world, participating in demonstrations and competitions, but in the early 90s, the skateboard boom quietly faded away, and Tony's income dropped sharply. Now he had to live on five dollars a day, which he received from TacoBell.
					In 1998, Tony and his family created the children's skatewear brand Hawk Clothing. A year later, skating again soared to an unprecedented height, from which it has not yet fallen. Tony's career took off even more and, in many ways, became the reason for the return of the culture of skateboarding to the youth environment. Hawk performed extreme stunts, especially the element called "900" at the 1999 X Games. It involved spinning two and a half turns in the air on a skateboard. Tony succeeded on his twelfth try and then said, "This is the best day of my life."

				<p>In 2011, Hawke was able to repeat this. He posted a video on his Twitter account saying, "I'm 43 and I did it." 900 today." Five years later, Tony performed what he claimed would be his last 900. In the video, the athlete said, “Spencer was on my first trick and now he was here on my last. Bye,” thus he dedicated 900 to his son, born in 1999.</p>
				
				<div class="rodney-mullen-desc">Rodney Mullen:</div>

				<p>Rodney Mullen is a legendary man who turned professional at age 13. It's no exaggeration to say that Rodney has done more to develop the skateboard than all the pros put together. But life turned out in such a way that Mullen was never able to earn either wealth or loud fame.
					Rodney Mullen was born in the small town of Gainesville, in the warm state of Florida, where they play baseball, golf and swim all year round. Rodney grew up as a smart and well-mannered boy, his parents did not want their son to go in for "this dangerous sport." Rodney was stubborn and accurate, skied regularly in pads and remained in good health. Dad could not forbid him to ride. Despite such harsh conditions, and perhaps in spite of them, Mullen progressed rapidly. In less than a year, he learned to skate so well that he got his first sponsor - a local skate shop.
					From the age of eleven, Rodney tirelessly skated for hours on end. His skill progressed at an incredible rate, and less than a year later, the first sponsors of Rodney Mullen appeared - a local skate shop. The guy quickly developed, and the first competition was not long in coming. First, he performed at the Florida, and then at the Californian competitions. In 1980, a new skateboard star lit up - he won the main US competition. Recall that at that time he was only thirteen years old.

				<p>At first, Rodney Mullen thought about leaving the sport, but he was invited to play for the Plan B company, which had a special weight in this sport. Skater began to explore a new world for himself, which opened up huge opportunities for development. And it took quite a bit of time until Mullen was again at the top of Olympus. Interestingly, while working with the board, Rodney was constantly coming up with new tricks that became the basis of the basics in a skateboard. Well, the man himself only modestly says that yes, he created them, but this was only the next step in his development.
					"Olie" (Oilie) - a fundamental element for any novice athlete. This element helps the skater to jump on a hill or jump over more than a dozen steps. This trick is the merit of Mullen. Rodney Mullen started a new era in street skating. Everything that was previously performed on a flat surface, the skate professional transferred to all sorts of bumps and obstacles, and with incredible speed of execution.
					After that, he invented a huge number of tricks that have become staples in skateboarding.
