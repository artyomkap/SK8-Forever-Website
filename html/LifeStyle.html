				<p>Thrasher is more than just a skateboard magazine. It's an iconic publication that chronicles the evolution of street culture through a skater's perspective.
					Thrasher was founded by Eric Swenson and Fausto Vitello in 1981 in San Francisco, California.
					Eric Leon Swenson was born on August 4, 1946, in San Francisco. He was a fan of punk music and hard rock and loved playing guitar and repairing motorcycles. His future business partner, Fausto Vitello, was born three days later, on August 7, 1946, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The duo met in the 1960s in the US Army Reserve, and the mutual passion for motorcycles morphed into a unique friendship. In 1978,     Swenson and Vitello teamed up with Richard Novak and Jay                                                      Shuirman and co-founded the Independent Truck Company. Three years later, in January 1981, the friends launched Thrasher Skateboard Magazine, a publication that was supposed to be a vehicle to promote their skate truck firm.

			<p>After a short period of time, the magazine has spread widely in society and gained incredible popularity. The army of fans grew steadily, and a small magazine grew into a solid publication about skateboarding, known throughout the world. In addition to the printed version, an electronic version was released, which greatly expanded the capabilities of Thrasher. Thanks to the forum, the flow of information has increased, many videos have appeared, and communication with the viewer has strengthened.
				After success in the field of printing, the friends decided to expand their field of activity and started designing clothes. The name remains the same, because the theme has not changed. Lines of clothing and accessories, mainly in sports performance, because the company continues to follow its strategy, promoting sports, love for skateboards, and an active lifestyle. Since the central audience of the brand is the youth sector, the pricing policy of the company is quite acceptable. At a low cost, goods are not inferior to competitors in terms of quality.
				Since the company's employees have considerable experience in extreme skateboarding, it is not difficult to develop clothes for this direction, because the whole kitchen is known to the guys from the inside. Therefore, modern fashion trends and characteristic features of sports topics are harmoniously intertwined in the lines. All products from the Thrasher brand are distinguished by an increased level of comfort due to the wide cut. Freedom of movement is not limited, and the temperamental, recognizable style of the author's images pleases the eye with magnificence.

				<div class="thrasher-desc">Skate or Die:</div>

			<p>Skate or die. Today, nearly every skateboarder knows or has come across this phrase. You've probably read it on a magazine, t-shirt, website, video game, sprayed as graffiti on walls, or even tattooed in someone's arm. But you could've also heard it on the TV, in a movie, or at a skatepark.
				"Skate or die" is one of the expressions that better reflects skateboarding's rich culture and lifestyle. It's a battle cry. It's the emotional expression of a real skater's heart. It epitomizes the life of a hardcore skater. It's a raw and timeless motto that captures the spirit and essence of skateboarding. "Skate or die" is a slang catchphrase that invites sidewalk surfers to escape and experience pure freedom and gives meaning to their lives. "Without skateboarding, life isn't worth living. To be denied the right to skate is a fate worse than death," you could say. Go skate, or get dead - ride a skateboard 'til death do us part.
				Once the catchphrase hit the ground running, several products took advantage of the expression's potential. "Skate or die" was used in arcade machines, video games, clothing, DVDs, skate merchandise, skate shop names, patches, record labels, shoes, stickers, and many other items. Bones Brigade - the band - also wrote a song titled "Skate or Die." 
				The famous skateboard expression is also the name of a 2008 French action movie by Miguel Courtois. Believe it or not, "Skate or Die" is also the name of a font that includes special skate-related characters. The same title was given to Episode 21, Season 19 of "Law & Order," the American police and legal drama series that aired on NBC between 1990 and 2010. Last but not least, the famous "skate or die" meme. On January 7, 2014, a used published on Tumblr a picture of Aladdin with the following words: "Skate or die, dude. You either skate, or you die." The meme went viral and inspired many other variations.
