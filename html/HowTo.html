				<p><blockquote>1. The very first step before you start riding a skateboard is to determine your position.
					There are two positions in skateboarding:
					Regular when the left foot is in front of the skateboard
					Goofy when the right foot is in front of the skateboard.
					If your main stance is regular and you goofy it's called a switch, the same thing happens if your main stance is goofy and you go regular.</blockquote>				
				
					<br><blockquote>2. The next step after you have determined your stance is to learn how to properly stand on the board.
					You should be parallel to the board with your front shoulder pointing towards the front of the board (knows).
					
					See how I stand in the video, such a stance allows you to better maintain balance on the board and maneuver when moving.</blockquote>
				
					<br><blockquote>3. The 3rd step after you have learned how to stand on the board is to learn how to stand to take off so you can pick up speed and just ride.
					You should turn your front foot 90 degrees in front of the board (toward the nose) so that your front foot is facing the direction of the movement so you can push more easily.
					After you have pushed off, you must return your leg to its original position, as was said in the 2nd step.</blockquote>					
				
					<br><blockquote>4. For turns on the board, you must shift your body weight in the direction of the turn so you can turn.
					Don't try to carry your body weight too hard as you risk falling.
					
					You can also use the tick-tock movement for turns, where you put your weight on the back of the board (tail) and lift the front wheels off the ground, then just turn in the direction you need to turn.
					This movement is useful during sharp turns.</blockquote>
				
					<br><blockquote>5. To brake on a skateboard you need to get into position as mentioned in step 3 and put your back foot out to brake, if you are riding at low speed you can just counter-brake, at high speed you can slide your soles a little on the pavement to Slow.
