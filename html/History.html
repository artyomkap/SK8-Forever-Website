            <p>Skateboarding is so much more than just skating. Skateboarding is a way of life and love. This sport has been developing for over 60 years and is still relevant today. Surfing became the progenitor of skateboarding in the 1950s.
            <br><blockquote>Some surfers have come up with ideas to bring the feel of the waves to the streets. No wonder these dudes were called "asphalt surfers." Skateboarding originated in California and Hawaii. For riding, surfers used short wooden surfboards with metal wheels without bearings. In the late 1950s, skateboarding gained a lot of popularity. By the late 1950s, the toy company recognized and became interested in skateboarding, they released the first official skateboard with new modifications, after which ride quality improved and skateboarders could come up with new tricks and maneuvers.

            <p><blockquote>A very important and significant event took place in 1963. It was the first skate contest in Hermos Beach, California. Skateboarding became more than just a cruise for surfers, but a discipline in which skateboarders could demonstrate their skills. Freestyle and Slalom were those disciplines. Some companies have started putting together teams and sponsoring skaters. Also in 1964, the first skateboarding magazine was created and called The Quarterly Skateboarder.
            </blockquote><blockquote>As mentioned above, the skateboard in the past had metal as well as clay wheels that clung to the asphalt and the walls of the pools (the kind of figures in skateparks). Frank Nasworthy, the man who revolutionized skate wheels, introduced urethane wheels in 1973 as a great alternative to metal or clay wheels. In parallel with him, the kicktail (raised back of the skateboard) was also invented. Thanks to this, skateboarding began to spread around the world, a lot of advertisements and magazines about skateboarding appeared.
